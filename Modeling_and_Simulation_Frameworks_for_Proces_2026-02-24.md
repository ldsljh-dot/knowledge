# Modeling and Simulation Frameworks for Processing-in-Memory ...

**Source**: [Modeling and Simulation Frameworks for Processing-in-Memory ...](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.00096)

## Snippet (via Tavily)

This hierarchical design enables researchers to transition seamlessly between fast design-space exploration and cycle-accurate full-system analysis within the same framework. By combining modular timing back-ends, flexible front-end interfaces, and broad architectural coverage, PIMSim provides a versatile and extensible foundation for investigating heterogeneous memory systems, host–PIM coherence, and near-data computation with consistent architectural semantics and reproducible results.

### 3.5 UPMEM Functional Simulator [...] MemTorch serves as a functional, modular, and execution-driven PIM-oriented simulator that spans multiple abstraction levels—from device and circuit modeling to algorithm and system integration. It provides researchers with a unified platform to investigate the effects of resistive memory variability and non-idealities on deep learning performance, enabling accurate hardware–software co-design and evaluation for next-generation compute-in-memory neural accelerators.

### 3.12 PiMulator [...] ### 3.8 MultiPIM

MultiPIM  is a detailed and highly configurable simulator for modeling large-scale Processing-in-Memory (PIM) systems built from multiple 3D-stacked memory devices. Unlike earlier single-stack frameworks such as PIMSim or Ramulator-PIM, it captures the realities of multi-stack interconnects, directory-based coherence, and virtual memory, all of which are essential to evaluate practical, scalable PIM designs.
